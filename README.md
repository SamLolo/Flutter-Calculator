# Flutter Calculator
A simple calculator app built using the flutter framework! This was produced at the end of the first in a series of workshops held by Hatless Studio and the University of Exeter Computing Society (EXCS). 

The calculator allows you to do the 4 basic functions: add, subtract, multiple & divide. It currently only works with integer inputs, but will provide float answers where necessary.
